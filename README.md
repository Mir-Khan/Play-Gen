# A Web App that uses Spotify's Web API
This app creates playlists en-masse in Spotify instead of one by one in the playlist. It accomplishes this by using the context of the playlist being modified or the listening history of the user using the app.

# Changelog
* v1.0 
    * Made a landing page with a log-in button, made the actual forms for playlist creation.
    * And also made a how to page to explain some notes when making a playlist using the tool.
* v1.1 
    * Fixed the server-side code to include less unneeded code. 
    * Also fixed the fact that quantities of more than 100 songs weren't being accepted by the form. The tool now works as advertised!
